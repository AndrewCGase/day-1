    <h1>Hello CodeWorks</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Andrew Gase</strong></p>

    <p>Born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, Andrew is an aspiring geophysicist. 
        He is currently completing a master's degree at Boise State University 
        where he studies the pyroclastic flow deposits from the 18 May 1980 eruption of 
        Mount St. Helens (Washington) with ground-penetrating radar and seismic 
        imaging. Andrew enrolled in Boise CodeWorks to gain experience with 
        software development. He hopes to apply skills taught at Boise CodeWorks
        to scientific and educational applications, and plans to begin a Ph.D. in 
        marine geophysics in fall 2017.    </p>
